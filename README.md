# Analysis of Customer Data (880660-M-6) at the University of Tilburg (ECommerce Website IntentPrediction Project)

Lecturer: Professor Boris ÄŒule and Dr. Giovanni Cassani

Aims:

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be familiar with the main aspects of handling transactional and sequential customer data. They will be aware of the most important pattern mining methods, as well as of the full variety of pattern types and algorithms that are currently available to practitioners in the field. Finally, they will have gained experience in applying some of these tools to a concrete real-world problem.

Learning goals:

After successfully completing this course, students are expected to be able to:

- describe the variety of formats customer data can come in and explain why different types of data need different analytical approaches
- define the concept of sequential pattern mining (SPM) and demonstrate how several SPM algorithms work
- discuss the limitations of frequent sequential pattern mining and critically compare various alternative ways to evaluate sequential patterns
- select and justify an appropriate algorithm to discover appropriate pattern types depending on the input data format and the desired insights to be gained
- apply customer data analytics tools on a specific real-world problem and implement error analysis methods

Content:

Customer data comes in many forms. While the basics such as market basket analysis are covered in other courses, in this course we focus on the sequential aspect of the data. The underlying assumption is that if events occur sequentially, then the order in which they occur is important and patterns that capture such sequential behaviour can offer valuable insights into the underlying data.

We start off by discussing some basic algorithms for mining frequent sequential patterns in the data. Later on, we discuss the limitations of frequency as a quality measure and introduce alternative measures for evaluating how interesting a pattern is to an end user. We also discuss a variety of forms the input data can come in, make a distinction between multiple data sequences and a single long event sequence, consider time stamped data and interval data, and discuss which pattern types and which algorithms are most suitable for each problem setting.

Parallel to the theory lectures, the students will be asked to complete a group assignment. Here, the aim is to deploy customer data analytics tools to a real-world problem. The assignment will be complementary to the theory lectures, in that the tools used will not necessarily be limited to those discussed in the lectures. However, the final written exam may well contain questions on material covered during the practical lectures.
