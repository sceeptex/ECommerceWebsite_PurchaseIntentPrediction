        "\n",
        "In its more general form, it boils down to anticipating what users will do during a browsing session. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Why?\n",
        "If we can predict what users want to do, we can take targeted actions to nudge them towards the action that maximises our utility: \n",
        "\n",
        "- keep users on the website longer (like <font color='blue'>FB</font> and <font color='blue'>Twitter</font> do) and thus see more ads\n",
        "- convince them to watch one more video, and thus one more ad (as <font color='red'>YT</font> does)\n",
        "- convince them to purchase one more item or a more expensive item or an item where our margin is higher (like <font color='orange'>Amazon</font> does). \n",
        "\n",
        "Intent prediction's business utility is tied to how effective the nudges we can implement are. From a scientific perspective, intent prediction is however interesting in its own right: to what extent can behavior (observed) inform about goals and motives (not observed)? What details about behavior do we need to adequatly infer goals?\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, if we can nudge users to buy something we can maybe improve our conversion rate, i.e. the proportion of visits where a user leaves after purchasing at least one item. Conversion rates are incredibly low for most eCommerce websites (around ~5%)\n",
        "\n",
        "## What?\n",
        "There are several intentions that can be predicted but here we focus on an eCommerce setting and on two very simple steps in a user trajectory: purchasing and adding to cart.\n",
        "\n",
        "### purchase v. no-purchase\n",
        "Will a user buy something by the end of the session?\n",
        "\n",
        "If we can detect someone is going to buy, we may decide not to offer discounts. If we detect someone is window-shopping, we may want to offer a discount to trigger a purchase or offer a coupon to come back and buy. Challenges: class imbalance and overfitting!\n",
        "\n",
        "### cart abandonement\n",
        "Very similar to the first one but limited to sessions where an item was added to cart. Cart abandonement is also affected by attrition factors, e.g. difficulty at payment time, so intent is only a part of the story.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class imbalance here is more moderate since purchases are more frequent among users who add something to cart but if we have to wait for an add-to-cart we might lose window-shoppers and can only predict later in the session.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* <font color='purple'>privacy, GDPR, and bad press</font>: storing personal information on customers is tricky from a legal standpoint and is considered less and less favorably by customers. Can we predict without relying on personal info (age, sex, gender, education level, wealth, ...)?\n",
        "\n",
        "* <font color='purple'>zero-shot prediction</font>: even if we rely on customer information, very often we don't have it because we have to predict a user's intent the first time we see that user, who doesn't have an account on the website or isn't logged in, so no personal info available (sure, third party cookies, but see the previous point). This type of user is the vast majority, especially for mid and small e-commerce platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "* <font color='purple'>predicting in real time</font>: some studies take full sessions as input, but if we can only find out a user will leave when they've already left, our algorithm is no good ->\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Early prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Same as intent prediction conceptually, but performed on unfolding sessions and thus partial information. We can aim to predict the next action or the next product (closer to recommender systems) or the overarching intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher business value, since we can take action at the right time; but much more challenging, since we predict based on fewer events and thus less information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get rolling now!\n",
